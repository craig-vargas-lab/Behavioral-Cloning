# Behavioral Cloning

This repository contains an experiment to use Convolutional Neural Networks to clone driving behavior.  Information about the experiment can be found in the [Write-up](./writeup.md)

Instructions on how to replicate the experiment will come in the future once I get time to better document the process.  The code is commented so you are welcome dig in.
